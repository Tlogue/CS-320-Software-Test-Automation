To ensure my code or program is functional and secure I can try my best to identify the needs of the product owner and stakeholders before coding. As well I can implement functions one at a time based on their priority. To assist with security for my program I will need to stay up to date on the latest security implementations in use and what is effective. I interpret users' needs and incorporate them into the programs being developed by identifying needs through collaboration/communication. I approach designing software with a systematic approach to assist me in developing more efficiently.
